# imgur_scraper

Was trying to download an album from imgur.com the download link was broken. "Download link expired" it said. Built a scraper with selenium as a work around.

## Setup
You need to have selenium webdrive downloaded (http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) and you need to put the executable in your assets folder.

Then you just run:
```
python imgur_scraper.py
```
